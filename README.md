# COUPON ACCEPTANCE PREDICTION IN IN-VEHICLE SCENARIOS

## Introduction

With the rise of autonomous and connected vehicles, personalized in-car advertising such as coupon offers can enhance customer engagement. The effectiveness of these advertisements largely depends on the predictive models that power them. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the acceptance of in-vehicle coupons, considering various driver and situational factors.

## Objectives

- To predict in-vehicle coupon acceptance with high accuracy.
- To compare various machine learning algorithms and determine the most effective for our purpose.
- To factor in diverse variables, including destination, weather, travel time, passenger details, and personal demographics.

## Methodology

We employed a range of machine learning techniques, starting with basic algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees, and advancing to more complex models such as Support Vector Machines and Gradient-boosted decision trees. We've focused on robust practices like regularization and dimensionality reduction to improve our models' performance and generalizability.

## Dataset

Dataset used is : UCI Machine Learning Repository. (2020). In-vehicle coupon recommendation dataset. Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.24432/C5GS4P
The dataset used in this project has been thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed to ensure high-quality inputs for our models. 

## Results

Our model evaluation centered on metrics like the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), with our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieving a test AUC of 0.84 and an accuracy of 0.77. These insights provide a solid foundation for creating more effective and personalized promotional strategies in in-vehicle scenarios.

## Conclusion

We've identified that coupon types, expiration times, destination, travel time, and customer demographics significantly influence coupon acceptance rates. These findings can guide marketers in creating more targeted and successful promotional campaigns.
